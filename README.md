# AI Architecture Generator  
### Agent-Orchestrated AI Design Engine (IBM Hackathon)

## Overview
AI Architecture Generator is an agent-orchestrated AI system that converts high-level project ideas into detailed, deployable AI architecture blueprints. Unlike traditional chatbots, this system executes a sequence of specialized AI agents, each responsible for a distinct architectural decision such as model selection, data strategy, deployment planning, scalability, cost estimation, and risk mitigation.

The project demonstrates how complex AI solution design can be automated using structured agent workflows powered by IBM watsonx foundation models.

## Key Features
- Agent-based orchestration (not a chatbot)
- Structured AI architecture generation
- Deployment-ready blueprint output
- Cost, risk, and scalability analysis
- IBM Cloud–aligned architecture recommendations
- Professional Streamlit-based UI

---

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- IBM watsonx Foundation Models
- Agent-based decision orchestration
- IBM Cloud architecture principles

---

## How It Works
1. User inputs an AI project idea.
2. Specialized AI agents execute sequentially:
   - Requirements analysis
   - Model and data strategy
   - Deployment planning
   - Cost and scalability estimation
   - Risk and mitigation analysis
3. A complete AI architecture blueprint is generated.
4. Output is structured, explainable, and deployment-oriented.

## Why This Is Not a Chatbot
This system does not engage in conversational dialogue. Instead, it performs deterministic, multi-agent orchestration where each agent produces explicit technical decisions. This aligns with enterprise-grade AI system design rather than consumer chat interfaces.

---

## Hackathon Alignment
- Demonstrates Agentic AI concepts
- Uses IBM watsonx ecosystem
- Focuses on real-world, deployable AI solutions
- Emphasizes transparency, explainability, and governance
